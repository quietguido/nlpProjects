# 1. Familiarize yourself with the Yelp data. Split the provided train set into (new) train (70% of the whole dataset) and validation (10% of the whole dataset) subsets. Describe the data. (5) Note: We will reuse the splits in the next labs, so fix the random state.
# 2. The starter notebook uses CountVectorizer to convert texts into vectors and MultinomialNB classifier. Experiment with different vectorizer parameters (use of stopwords, minimum document frequency, binary features, and lowercasing) and the smoothing parameter of the NB classifier. Select the best configuration based on the validation set, apply it to the test set. (25)
# a. Experiment with a different classifier (e.g. SVM). (10)

# In summary, the MNB model with its specific hyperparameters performed slightly better 
# than the SVC model with its specific hyperparameters on the validation set.
# However, the performance of these models on unseen test data may vary.
# We can observe that the best combination of hyperparameters for the MNB model is 
# min_df=1, stop_words=None, binary=False, lowercase=True, and alpha=0.5,
# while the best combination of hyperparameters for the SVC model is
# min_df=1, stop_words='english', binary=False, lowercase=False, and alpha=0.01.
# the minimum document frequency meaning a word must be found 
# in at least one document to be included in the vocabulary,
# showed best results when set to 1 in both models

# Also, the same corrolation can be seen in binary parameter = false, which means that 
# the count of words in each document is used as the feature value.
# However, the lowercase, stop_words and alpha parameters showed different results in both models.
# Overall, distribution suggested that the MNB model performed better than the SVC model.
# But, huge factor of the performance of both fectors were connected to 
# how we split the data using randmo_state. 






# 3. Familiarize yourself with the SentiWord lexicon. Process and describe the data. (5)
# 4. Develop a lexicon-based sentiment classifier using Stanza for lemmatization and POS-
# tagging. (Mind difference in labeling: sentences: 0 – negative, 1 – positive; words: continuous scores from the range [-1, 1]. Note that SentiWords and Stanza use different POS tag sets.) (35)
# a. Use validation set to optimize the threshold value for binary classification. (10) 5. Summarize and compare the evaluation results (accuracy on the test set) of all tested
# configurations. Analyze misclassified examples. (10)

# # Best Threshold: 0.0, Best Accuracy: 0.7
# The task involved building a sentiment classifier using pre-existing 
# sentiment scores from the SentiWord lexicon and leveraging Stanza 
# for text preprocessing. By fine-tuning the classification threshold using 
# a validation set, the best threshold of 0.0 yielded a 70% accuracy rate.
# Despite its simplicity and transparency, this approach is contingent upon
# the accuracy of the sentiment lexicon and text processing steps, potentially
# limiting its effectiveness in capturing nuanced sentiment nuances. 
# Further refinement and evaluation across varied datasets are essential 
# for enhancing its reliability and applicability in real-world scenarios.

# Example usage: 

# # [('I', 'PRON'), ('have', 'AUX'), ('have', 'VERB'), ('good', 'ADJ'), ('day', 'NOUN'), (';', 'PUNCT'), ('today', 'NOUN'), ('be', 'AUX'), ('not', 'PART'), ('great', 'ADJ'), ('.', 'PUNCT')]
# # I .
# # have .
# # have v
# # adding score 0.22859
# # good .
# # day n
# # adding score 0.34355
# # ; .
# # today n
# # adding score 0.10554
# # be .
# # not .
# # great .
# # . .

#  Also from the usage case you can observe that the lemmatization and POS tagging
#  was done correctly and the sentiment score was calculated correctly. 
# But the Pos tags for the pronounses where not found in the SentiWord lexicon
# which is why the score was not added.
# and the score for the word "great" was not added because
#  the word was not found in the lexicon.
